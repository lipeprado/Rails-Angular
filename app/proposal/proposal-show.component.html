<p>It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project requirements, I believe it is a
greate fit for the types of applications that I build out. Please Feel free to check out some of my
past projects <strong><a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}" target="_blank">{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}</a></strong>.</p>

<p>To successfully build out the application  I will be utillizing {{ proposal.tools }},
and a number of other tools to ensure that the project Follows industry wide best practices.</p>


<p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating
everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and seending
you a project update message daily so that you can have aa transparent view of the development as it takes place.</p>

<p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements tha we discussed, I am estimating that it will take <strong>{{ proposal.estimated_hours }}</strong> hours in development
time to complete. The project should take <strong>{{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }}</strong> weeks to comple and with my hourly rate of <strong>{{ proposal.hourly_rate | currency: 'USD' : true: '.0' }}/hour,</strong>
the estimate total will be <strong>{{ proposal.estimated_hours * proposal.hourly_rate | currency: 'USD' : true: '.0' }}</strong></p>

<p>The Next Step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.</p>

<em>I am  excited to working with you and build out this project.</em>
